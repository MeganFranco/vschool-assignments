##### Colossal Adventure

Project Description: http://coursework.vschool.io/colossal-adventure-console-rpg/

The goal of this project was to have an 80s type RPG for the command line, although there are fewer moving pieces.


This project has, by-far, the most code I've every written in one sitting to date -- and that's not including the actual story. I organized the program to contain variables at the top, functions below that, and then to run the actual game at the bottom. I was surprised that the hardest part wasn't in getting the functions to work, but in structuring the final game() function so that all of the moving pieces fit together. 

Another challenge I found was in getting the program to end gracefully if the user either died or won. The solution I have implemented right now was to wrap sections of the game and a few functions in if-statements, although I would like to go through this game again and use a while-loop instead.
