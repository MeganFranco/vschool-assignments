##### Business-Time

Project Description: http://coursework.vschool.io/business-time/

The goal of this project was to create a dynamic website for a proposed business venture. I made good use of the Bootsrap navbar to allow users to click through the Home, About, and product pages. 

I created a file in the projects folder for the most current blank layout so that if I wanted to add other categories of products (socks perhaps?) I would be able to do so easily, although this currently needs to be updated.
