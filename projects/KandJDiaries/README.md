##### This project was one of the most challenging, we were given a professionally developed website to emulate to the best of our ability. This was difficult for many reasons, the first of which was that I was going to have to create a lot of things I'd never created before such as a navigation bar, and sidebars. Second, there are a lot of different elements, and unique stylings for those elements on such a web page, and I had to find a way to organize and note where each I was creating snd styling each section imaginable. It was difficult to manage at first, but by the end of the project the size of the HTML and CSS files seemed a little less daunting. The third challenge is that everyone codes in a unique way, and not only did I have to attempt to emulate a professional website, but in a way it was also like attempting an art forgery (albiet a not very good one.)
