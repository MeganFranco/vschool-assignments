    <h3>People Wake Up and Do Stuff</h3>
    
    
    <p class="withImage"><img src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i311/paulath/Anchor%20Pics%206/AliceKeppel.jpg"> It appears that every morning around the world people just continue to wake up and do stuff. Despite the fact that they will die one day. "It's incredibly heart-warming to witness" said anthropologist <span>Alice Alice</span>. "It just inspires me to do the same" </p>
        
    <p>That being said the world is still a dangerous place to live in: but heres a random paragrapgh from the internet: "In 1875, a Massachusetts farmer, curious about the growing power of expanding apples, melons, and squashes, harnessed a squash to a weight-lifting device which had a dial like a grocer's scale to indicate the pressure exerted by the expanding fruit. As the days passed, he kept piling on counterbalancing weight; he could hardly believe his eyes when he saw his vegetables quietly exerting a lifting force of 5 thousand pounds per square inch. When nobody believed him, he set up exhibits of harnessed squashes and invited the public to come and see. The Annual Report of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, 1875, reported: <span> "Many thousands of men, women, and children of all classes of society visited it. Mr. Penlow watched it day and night, making hourly observations; Professor Parker was moved to write a poem about it; Professor Seelye declared that he positively stood in awe of it."</span> "</p>

    <p> and another: "But in the animal world things are different, and human feelings are different. While we're in New York, consider the cockroaches under the bed and the rats in the early morning clustered on the porch stoop. Apartment houses are hives of swarming roaches. Or again: in one sense you could think of Manhattan's land as high-rent, high-rise real estate; in another sense you could see it as an enormous breeding ground for rats, acres and acres of rats. I suppose that the cockroaches don't do as much actual damage as the roots do; nevertheless, the prospect does not please. Fecundity is anathema only in the animal. <span> "Acres and acres of rats"</span> has a suitably chilling ring to it that is decidedly lacking if I say instead <span>"acres and acres of tulips."</span>"</p>
