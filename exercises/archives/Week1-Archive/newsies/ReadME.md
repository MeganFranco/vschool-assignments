Recreate the front page of a newspaper using block and inline elements

The newspaper should have:

-A header with the name of your newspaper

-A title for the front page article

-A three columned body using p tags. (Hint: you will need to alter the display characteristic.)

-Several words in the body should be individually styled using inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)

-An image within the body of the article.
