Challenge
Create a collection of employee's information for your company. Each employee has the following attributes:

-Name
-Job title
-Salary
-Status

First, you will create an array named employees

Next, you will create an Employee prototype with the first three attributes defined at the time of instantiation and the fourth will be defaulted to "full-time".

This prototype will also have a method called printEmployeeForm that prints the employee's information to the console.

(e.g. "Name: Bob, Job Title: V School Instructor, Salary: $3000/hour, Status: Part time")

The employee prototype will also have a method called 'add' that pushes the newly created employee to the employees array.

You will then:

Instantiate three employees
Override the status attribute of one of them to either 'part time' or 'contract'
Then call the printEmployeeForm method for each employee
Lastly, you all call the add method on all the employees and console log the employees array to make sure they were all successfully added.
