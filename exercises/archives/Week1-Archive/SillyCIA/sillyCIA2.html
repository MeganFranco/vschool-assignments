        <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
        <p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
