Using the NodeJS package readline-sync, create an interactive program that asks you some personal information (name, age, favorite color, etc.) and reports back to you what you entered. Make sure to include the following string manipulations:

Make one of the inputs all uppercase (i.e., given the string “hello” print “HELLO”)
Report back the number of characters in a given input
Concatenate (add) two separate strings together
Given a long message (more than twenty letters), return only the last half of the message
Using the same long message (but without making the user type it in again), have your program print it to the terminal for the user to read again, but allow the user to tell your program where to begin typing from (i.e., which index to start from).
Program specifications:

You must use the readline-sync package.
Make sure to store all input from the user in a variable using the question method of the readline-sync package.
Use special string characters such as the newline character \n, or the tab character \t to make your output more readable.
